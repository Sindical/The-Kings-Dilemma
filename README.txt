The King's Dilemma
Welcome to The King's Dilemma, a text-based adventure game where you make choices that will determine the fate of the kingdom. 
You play as a king, and your decisions will have a significant impact on the story's outcome.

How to Play
- To start playing, simply run the game file in your terminal or command prompt. The game will begin by introducing you to the story. 
- To make a desistion simply input "1" or "2", If given a special question input a random number.
- Throughout the game, you will be presented with different scenarios and options to choose from. Use your critical thinking skills to make
the best decision for the kingdom, as your choices will ultimately determine the outcome of the story. Be careful, though! Some choices may
have unintended consequences and could lead to a less desirable ending.

Game Mechanics
- The game is text-based, meaning that all interactions will be done through text input and output. To select a choice, type the number
corresponding to the option you want to choose. If given a special question that asks to input a number, simply input a random number.
- The game will NOT keep track of your progress, so you can't pick up where you left off. Each ending takes roughly 1 minute to obtain and
their are 20 endings. So 20 mins of total game time. If you can get all endingsm you get a secret message!
